# OPI Lab Goals

The OPI members may contribute some hardware
to be co-managed between the member and the lab staff.
Having hardware in the OPI lab helps
to validate compatibility and to avoid regressions.

## Usage

The OPI lab should be used for:

- automatic testing
  - Phase 1:
    - Functional validation and regression
       - scheduled functional validation
       - patch validation (CI)
    - Conformance
  - Phase 2: 
    - Interoperability
      - Reserve IPU/DPUs from multiple vendors to run the test
      - Test portability, compatibility

 - manual
   - Drive adoption  
     - Demos, Conferences - OPI Lab preferred
     - Learning, Training - Vendor Lab preferred
     - Development lab for SW vendors

The performance data generated in the lab shall not be used
for competitive marketing purposes.
Conformance data or certifications from OPI labs can be used for marketing purposes.

## Properties

In order to serve the OPI community, these properties should be targetted:

- reliability: always running, without false positive result
- neutrality: same automatic tests and configurations on all HW/SW platforms
- security: access is restricted to avoid unexpected changes

# OPI Lab Goals

The OPI members may contribute some hardware
to be co-managed between the member and the lab staff.
Having hardware in the OPI lab helps
to validate compatibility and to avoid regressions.

## Usage

The OPI lab should be used for:

- automatic testing

  - scheduled functional validation
  - patch validation (CI)

The data generated in the lab shall not be used
for competitive marketing purposes.

## Properties

In order to serve the OPI community, these properties should be targetted:

- reliability: always running, without false positive result
- neutrality: same automatic tests and configurations on all HW/SW platforms
- security: access is restricted to avoid unexpected changes
